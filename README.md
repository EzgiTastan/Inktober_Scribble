# Inktober Scribble

## Description:
Generate a random inktober scribble using Python's turtle module. Artists can use this as a template for their inktober drawings.

## Usage:
1. Run the Python script to generate a random inktober scribble.
2. Stop the script at any time to capture the generated scribble.
3. Use the generated scribble as a template for your inktober drawing.

## How it works:
The script starts by drawing a square. This square part is expected to be your main character's head/body. Then, it adds random lines with varying lengths and angles to create a unique scribble. As a result, you can benefit from the randomness of the lines for your unique Inktober drawing.

This project draws inspiration from the Inktober challenge, a celebration of creativity in the art community. Additionally, it pays homage to the role of randomness in game development, where it often fuels the design of captivating and unpredictable environments. As a developer who's ventured into game design myself, I understand the power of randomness in sparking creativity and innovation.
